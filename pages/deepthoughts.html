      Sometimes I think about random things. Like what is the universe? How big is it? How small are we? Having time to myself produces further questions, many of which may never be answered. Like what is nothing? Does time go on to infinity? Are we the only civilization that cannot comprehend infinity? Also, what would infinity be to the smallest scale? What is smaller than a planck length? Is it possible that the Quantum Realm actually exists? There are even more questions that may never be answered by humans, but only time will tell.
